Description: Provides tools for performing Bayesian inference on epidemiological 
  data to estimate the time-varying reproductive number and other related metrics.
  These methods were published in Li and White (2021) <doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009210>.
  This package supports analyses based on aggregated case count data and individual line list 
  data, facilitating enhanced surveillance and intervention planning for infectious 
  diseases like COVID-19.
